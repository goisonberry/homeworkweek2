## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to develop a responsive website about myself and the things that I enjoy.

### General

### Index

Initial: I began working on the index.html file by creating a simple layout of how I wanted the page to look like. I started off with a simple navbar, added a temporary image so being styling my text around it. I added two paragraph elements with two different classes to see which one would be more responsive as the page is built. I linked the portfolio and content html files to the links. I added a generic footer.

### Portfolio

Initial: I added the same navbar as I did with the index html file. I then added 4 divs with card classes and used a temporary image as a placeholder to have an idea of how the cards would look like. I proceeded to add a link button with a temporary link to each card to direct the user to Google.com. I also added a temporary footer to know how to begin styling it.

### Contact

Initial: I, once again, added the same navbar as I did with the portfolio and imdex html files. I added a temporary form element to as a base to see what will work on different devices without breaking the page. I also added the same footer as the previous two files in order to have idea of how to style the footer and to keep consistent across all of the pages.
