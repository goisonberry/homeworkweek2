## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to develop a responsive website about myself.

### Development

This task was very difficult to create. I understand the purpose of using bootstrap, but the concept of putting everything together has been extremely challenging. The most difficult part for me has been creating an actual responsive website. No matter what elements I utilize, the pages just do not come out the way they're supposed to. I tried to use flexfit, columns, rows, containers. Nothing seems to work. I stated my pages 4 times to see if i was missing something, but nothing seems to be clicking. This is not my best work or the reflection of my lack of trying. I just simply do not understand how to connect these concepts to make a responsive wedsbite. I just need more practice and more time to figure these concepts out.

Although the my homework is not complete, I plan to continue working on these webpages as I deteremined to make them work and understand the general concept.
